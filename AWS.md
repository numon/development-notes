### AWS Availability Zones

• Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more
discrete data centers with redundant power,
networking, and connectivity
• They’re separate from each other, so that
they’re isolated from disasters
• They’re connected with high bandwidth,
ultra-low latency networking

### IAM
• IAM (Identity and Access Management) • Your whole AWS security is there: • Users • Groups • Roles 
• Root account should never be used (and shared) 
• Users must be created with proper permissions 
• IAM is at the center of AWS • Policies are written in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
