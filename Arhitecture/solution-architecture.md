  - functional
  - Constraints
  - Quality attributes

- Constraints
  technical, time and budget, people

- Quality attributes
   `Patterns for fault tolerant software` - Book
   
   `Software architecture in Practice` - book
  
  
  
 FE Performace tactics
 - Improve User experience 
 - Optimize Resources (js, css, images, fonts, etc)
 - caching
 - critical path
 - compression
 - http/2

  - Supports and covers all business goals
  - Product of a single architect of small group
  - FUnction requirements and prioritized list of quality attribute
  - Well documented
  - circulated to the systems stakehilders

  - shoul lend itself to incremental implementation 
  - all resources concerns should be worked outm documented and expalined to the development team
