## Flex
`display: flex` - The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

- flex-start - snuggle to top
- flex-end - snuggle to bottom
- center - center
- baseline - on center line
- stretch - snuggle to top with heght 100%

The `justify-content` property is used to align the flex items:
- `justify-content: center;`     /* Pack items around the center */
- `justify-content: start;`     /* Pack items from the start */
- `justify-content: end;`        /* Pack items from the end */
- `justify-content: flex-start;` /* Pack flex items from the start */
- `justify-content: flex-end;`   /* Pack flex items from the end */
- `justify-content: left;`       /* Pack items from the left */
- `justify-content: right;`     /* Pack items from the right */

`flex-direction`
The flex-direction CSS property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis

- `flex-direction: row;` /* The direction text is laid out in a line */. 
- `flex-direction: row-reverse;` /* Like <row>, but reversed */. 
- `flex-direction: column;` /* The direction in which lines of text are stacked */. 
- `flex-direction: column-reverse;` /* Like <column>, but reversed */.
